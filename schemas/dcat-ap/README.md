# Maven module containing dcat-ap schema plugin

To include this schema plugin in a build, copy the dcat-ap schema folder in the 
schemas folder, add it to the schemas/pom.xml 
and add it to the copy-schemas execution in web/pom.xml.


For GeoNetwork 3.0.1 use schema-ident-3.0.1.xml rather than schema-ident.xml (so rename it).
